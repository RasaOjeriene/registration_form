            Hi, Iâ€™m Rasa. I seek the balance between composition, light and emotion; in search of the perfection in the imperfection. Capturing sincere moments of authentic connection and revealing the raw, intense, funny and even fragile feelings that will color your future memories; for me that is what photography is all about.
Through my work I seek to reveal your unique personality and document the essence of your life and love unfolding naturally through compelling photographs that stand the test of time.
I currently live in Kaunas, Lithuania, and travel throughout Europe and around the world for weddings, family documentary portraits, and commercial assignments.
